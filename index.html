							<h2>LIFE</h2>
							<h3>Life is something incredible and the most admired thing in the world by all people.</h3>
							<P>Although people admire life and no one admires to lose it but we are the ones who make it to reach it to an end through the things we do in life and this may include every day enjoyments, travel times, and every day participations. </P>
							<p>The more we do those daily activities in wrong way, a slight mistake puts our life in a risk e.g., you are travelling in or on any transport mean either a bicycle or a car, moving on normal speed and unwantedly you increase the speed for fun unknowingly you can lose your life. Just like that life is gone.</p>
							<p>Many days we participate in things which may affect our life biologically and this include alcohol drinking(addictive’s) and also stressing yourself may harm your health    </p>
							<p>Life has no a warranty, never take your life for granted because your life may be the one to put someone’s life or future in a better place meaning that your life is in position for another’s better future and this also means your life is useful.</p>
							<p>Don’t forget to love your mum always.</p>

							<h2>YOU WONDER</h2>
							<h3>Life is a mysterious thing in this world and I wonder where it is taking us because it is full of mistakes done by us people leading to its end.</h3>
							<p>Have you ever wondered why a cat is said to have nine lives , it is always smart and kin of what it is doing neither hygiene nor its social life. But us people who understand more than a cat we have one life or God’s mercy because we are ever dirty in what ever we do, including  our social life is full  of bad acts.</p>
							<p>Life is not short but we cut it short due to our behaviors.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="leaders">
							<h2>YOU LEADERS</h2>
							<h3>If are a leader and you really love the people you lead and take over, please mind of the people you lead and what you do at them just sit back and think about it because you may regret by seeing people changing yet you are the one leading to their change, this may be positive or negative to you.</h3>
							<p>In most cases you leaders think that you are more than human beings giving no respect to the people you lead and then giving them and extra mind to think at the way to escape you and letting you down. Letting them give you a bad memory back to you but please never blame them it was you.</p>
							<p>Don’t put your self into a state of stupidity “knowing the truth and still believing in lies”. Many leaders think of being great but nothing you will gain in this world, only curses and bad wishes to you. Also mind of the children you have if you have, are you teaching them respect to other people or giving them bad advices and teaching them not how to live in the society with others.</P>
							<p>What do think will happen to them when you the world, will they be welcomed or chased away and serving your punishments you left. Mind of the way you also teach your children because many of you don’t want your children to work including house work letting them to be lazy and useless   to the society plus fording them to serve world punishments.</p>
							<p>Now mind also about your mouth, most of you have no respect in the way you speak to people. Regardless of the children, public and their family you don’t give shame to your mouth when speaking to the people you lead. You may have helped them but it dosen’t mean to speak to them any how because they also need respect as you also need it.</p>
							<p>Whenever you are speaking to them give them some respect because it hurts them when you just speak to them regardless of the words you are putting out and the public around. Life has no warranty you never this people you are mistreating are the one to help your children when you are gone. </p>
